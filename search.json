    "text": "Reviving an old Twitter thread to expedite my first ever blog contribution; as a lifelong environmentalist, I’m a fan of recycling. If you want to check out the original thread, and its total lack of engagement, it’s here.\nYou might have seen the UK government plans to tighten restrictions for field solar on farmland back in October last year. Although it didn’t go through in the end, the false dichotomy of farming vs solar energy keeps getting peddled. Here’s ITV going all clickbait with “Heating or eating?”. Most commentators I’ve seen use non-spatial figures so I decided to dive into the spatial data to answer the question: has the government “fixed” a non-existent problem?"

In those conversations, the role of nature will be paramount. Nature-based solutions will play an integral role in the fight against climate change, which has made them one of the key presidential themes for COP26. Nature also underpins the ecological emergency which is interlinked with the climate crisis.\nThis panel event will place the COP26 theme of nature-based solutions within the context of the wider sustainability agenda, especially the upcoming COP15 for the Convention on Biological Diversity. Our expert panellists will link the two Conventions and their conferences through the lens of nature and nature-based solutions, giving attendees insights into what they should expect ahead of COP15, the links between the two conferences, and the importance of nature as a key element of both high-level discussions.\nA time-stamped recording of the event is here.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dunnett2021,\n  author = {Seb Dunnett},\n  title = {Nature-Based Solutions: The {Conventions} on {Climate} \\&\n    {Biodiversity}},\n  date = {2021-05-19},\n  url = {http://sebdunnett.com/talks/2021-05-19-cieem-rsb-ies/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSeb Dunnett. 2021. “Nature-Based Solutions: The Conventions on\nClimate & Biodiversity.” May 19, 2021. http://sebdunnett.com/talks/2021-05-19-cieem-rsb-ies/."
