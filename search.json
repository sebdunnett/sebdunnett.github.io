    "text": "Reviving an old Twitter thread to expedite my first ever blog contribution; as a lifelong environmentalist, I’m a fan of recycling. If you want to check out the original thread, and its total lack of engagement, it’s here.\nYou might have seen the UK government plans to tighten restrictions for field solar on farmland back in October last year. Most commentators I’ve seen use non-spatial figures so I decided to dive into the spatial data to answer the question: has the government “fixed” a non-existent problem?\n\n\nShow/hide code\nif (!require(pacman,quietly = TRUE)) install.packages('pacman')\nlibrary(pacman)\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse,sf,scico,scales)\n\n# always a useful function to include\n`%ni%` <- Negate(`%in%`)\n\n# British National Grid\nprj = st_crs(27700)\n\n# UK & Eng boundaries\nuk = st_read(\"data/uk.json\", quiet=TRUE) %>%\n  st_make_valid\neng = st_read(\"data/eng.geojson\", quiet=TRUE)\n\n\n\nSolar in the UK\n\n\n\nSolar farm in England. Photo by Red Zeppelin on Unsplash\n\n\nFirstly, we need data for solar locations. Back in 2016 when I started my PhD, there were very little spatial data for renewable energy – one of the drivers for my first paper; thankfully it’s not as bad now. I used data from a study that took a similar approach to ours, but with a much more detailed focus on the UK.\n\n\nShow/hide code\n# polygons from Stowell et al\nsolar = st_read(\"data/ukpvgeo_geometries.geojson\", quiet=TRUE) %>% \n  st_transform(prj)\n\nsolar_poly_area_km2 = sum(st_area(solar)) %>% units::set_units(km2)\n\n# points from Stowell et al\nsolar_pts = read.csv(\"data/ukpvgeo_points.csv\") %>%\n  drop_na(latitude,longitude) %>%\n  st_as_sf(coords=c(\"longitude\",\"latitude\"),crs=4326) %>%\n  st_transform(27700) %>% \n  filter(located %ni% c(\"roof\",\"rood\",\"roof`\",\"root\")) # couple of spelling mistakes in the data\n\nsolar_uk_area_km2 = sum(solar_pts$area_sqm,na.rm=T) %>% units::set_units(m2) %>% units::set_units(km2)\nsolar_uk_pct = solar_uk_area_km2/(sum(st_area(uk)) %>% units::set_units(km2))\n\n\nStowell et al. produced point data with area as an attribute, as well as polygons; the difference between the two was only 2.9. I ended up using areas calculated from the polygons. This gave the percentage of land used for solar in the UK as a whopping 0.097%.\n\n\nAgricultural grading\nSo here’s the crux of the issue: agricultural land classification. 1 is best, 5 is worst. In practice, 3 is split into 3a and 3b, but I’m using data from Natural England that annoyingly doesn’t split 3 so we’ll have to make do.\n\n\nShow/hide code\nalc = st_read(\"data/Provisional_Agricultural_Land_Classification_(ALC)_(England).geojson\",\n              quiet=TRUE) %>%\n  st_transform(27700) %>% \n  filter(ALC_GRADE!=\"Exclusion\")\n\nalc$AREA <- st_area(alc)\n\n# summarise by grade\nalc_summary = st_drop_geometry(alc) %>% \n  group_by(ALC_GRADE) %>% \n  summarise(total_area_sqm = sum(AREA,na.rm = T)) %>% \n  mutate(prop = total_area_sqm/sum(total_area_sqm))\n\n# palette for alc plot\nalc_pal = c(scico(n=5,palette=\"bamako\",direction = 1),\"lightblue\",\"darkgray\")\n\nggplot(alc %>% filter(ALC_GRADE!=\"Exclusion\")) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill=ALC_GRADE),col=NA) +\n  cowplot::theme_map() +\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"Agricultural grade\",values = alc_pal)\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of agricultural land classification grades in England.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dunnett2023,\n  author = {Seb Dunnett},\n  title = {UK Solar Versus Agricultural Production},\n  date = {2023-02-07},\n  url = {https://sebdunnett.github.io/posts/uk-agri-solar/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSeb Dunnett. 2023. “UK Solar Versus Agricultural\nProduction.” February 7, 2023. https://sebdunnett.github.io/posts/uk-agri-solar/."

They undeniably have wide-reaching and substantial impacts on biodiversity, and are often accused of having undue influence on policy. However, they also offer an important lever for change.
