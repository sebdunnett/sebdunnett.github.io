In those conversations, the role of nature will be paramount. Nature-based solutions will play an integral role in the fight against climate change, which has made them one of the key presidential themes for COP26. Nature also underpins the ecological emergency which is interlinked with the climate crisis.\nThis panel event will place the COP26 theme of nature-based solutions within the context of the wider sustainability agenda, especially the upcoming COP15 for the Convention on Biological Diversity. Our expert panellists will link the two Conventions and their conferences through the lens of nature and nature-based solutions, giving attendees insights into what they should expect ahead of COP15, the links between the two conferences, and the importance of nature as a key element of both high-level discussions.\nA time-stamped recording of the event is here.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{dunnett2021,\n  author = {Dunnett, Seb},\n  title = {Nature-Based Solutions: The {Conventions} on {Climate} \\&\n    {Biodiversity}},\n  date = {2021-05-19},\n  url = {http://sebdunnett.com/talks/2021-05-19-cieem-rsb-ies/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDunnett, Seb. 2021. “Nature-Based Solutions: The Conventions on\nClimate & Biodiversity.” May 19, 2021. http://sebdunnett.com/talks/2021-05-19-cieem-rsb-ies/."

But that’s running into opposition from those who see a contradiction between nature protection and energy and food security. Looking ahead, the EU is set to triple the build out of wind and solar capacity by 2030. Can Europe fight both crises?\nLast year, Eurelectric launched the PowerPlant project focused on reshaping the public discourse. The goal is to promote integrated RES and infrastructure projects, which serve to both speed up the decarbonisation of the energy system and contribute to regenerate some of the 81% of habitats which are degraded across the EU.\nWithin this context, ensuring an optimal spatial planning is the first step to both minimise the impact on nature while providing visibility for renewables developers. Based on the recently agreed renewables permitting framework, by mid-2024 EU Member States are mandated to map all land and water surfaces needed to reach their 2030 renewable energy objectives. Optimal zoning will require combined nature and energy planning based on data-driven intelligence and involving all the relevant stakeholders in a timely manner.\nThe panelists will explore various solutions to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis together, including:\n\nHow can we avoid impact on environmental sensitive areas while reaching the 2030 EU RES targets?\nWhat methodologies should Member States follow when mapping renewables suitable areas?\nWhat role for data-driven intelligence to ensure a sound energy transition planning?\nWhat is the electricity sector doing to minimise their impact on nature?
