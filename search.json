If you want to check out the original thread, and its total lack of engagement, it’s here.\nYou might have seen the UK government plans to tighten restrictions for field solar on farmland back in October last year. Although it didn’t go through in the end, the false dichotomy of farming vs solar energy keeps getting peddled. Here’s ITV going all clickbait with “Heating or eating?”. Most commentators I’ve seen use non-spatial figures so I decided to dive into the spatial data to answer the question: has the government “fixed” a non-existent problem?"

In 2012, I concluded that:\nIn the next few blog posts I’ll revisit some of the arguments supporting this conclusion and test them against ten years of further evidence to see whether a master’s dissertation in 2023 would agree: are offsets ineffective?"

It originated from an American policy that aimed to counter the alarming decline of wetlands in the country. In this first blog post, we’ll cover the basics of biodiversity offsetting, discuss its key principles, and explore different offset mechanisms.\nThe term “biodiversity offsets” refers to measurable conservation outcomes aimed at compensating for significant adverse impacts on biodiversity resulting from development projects. These offsets come into play after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been implemented. The primary goal of biodiversity offsets is to achieve no net loss, and ideally, a net gain in biodiversity on the ground. This encompasses various aspects, including species composition, habitat structure, ecosystem function, and the cultural values associated with biodiversity (Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) 2012)."

    "section": "Mitigation hierarchy: ensuring responsible offsetting",
    "text": "Mitigation hierarchy: ensuring responsible offsetting\nA crucial aspect of biodiversity offsetting is the concept of the mitigation hierarchy. This hierarchy serves as a guideline to prevent offsetting from becoming a “license to destroy”. According to this principle, offsets should only be utilized to compensate for genuinely unavoidable damage. To determine unavoidable impacts, options must be thoroughly explored to first avoid, minimize, or rehabilitate/restore the affected ecosystems (Lawton et al. 2010). The mitigation hierarchy comprises the following principles (Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) 2012):\n\nAvoidance: Measures taken to prevent impacts by carefully considering the spatial or temporal placement of infrastructure elements, thus completely avoiding harm to specific components of biodiversity.\nMinimization: Actions aimed at reducing the duration, intensity, and extent of impacts that cannot be entirely avoided, to the extent practically feasible.\nRehabilitation/Restoration: Efforts to restore degraded ecosystems or rehabilitate cleared ecosystems after exposure to impacts that could not be completely avoided or minimized.\nOffset: Measures undertaken to compensate for any residual significant adverse impacts that could not be avoided, minimized, rehabilitated, or restored. The goal is to achieve no net loss or even a net gain of biodiversity. Offsets can take the form of positive management interventions, such as restoring degraded habitats or protecting areas facing imminent or projected biodiversity loss.\n\n\n20122023\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mitigation hierarchy. Source: Rio Tinto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new and improved mitigation hierarchy. Source: Forest Trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, say we were building some infrastructure on some natural land. Firstly, we might avoid impacting some ancient oak trees by building a slightly more indirect access road. Secondly, we could minimise impacts by timing works to avoid the bird breeding season, and not work at night under lights to protect nocturnal species. After construction is complete, we would restore the access road to its original condition. If an offset policy were in place, we would then look to compensate for any residual impacts."

Key reports include TEEB, eftec and IEEP’s technical report for the EC, and Treweek Consultants’ scoping report for Defra. These reports have shed light on the potential of biodiversity offsetting to deliver effective compensation for biodiversity loss (TEEB 2010; eftec and IEEP 2010; Treweek 2009). In line with this, the BBOP released guidelines and standards for biodiversity offsetting, aiming to refine the measures further based on public consultation (Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) 2012)."

By adhering to the mitigation hierarchy and implementing effective offset mechanisms, we can strive for no net loss and even a net gain in biodiversity.
