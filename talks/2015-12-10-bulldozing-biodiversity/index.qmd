# Overview

The human race is two thirds of the way to having the same impact on biodiversity in their short lifetime on Earth than a 112-mile wide asteroid. Businesses often shoulder the lion's share of the blame for this. They undeniably have wide-reaching and substantial impacts on biodiversity, and are often accused of having undue influence on policy. However, they also offer an important lever for change. This talk will present UNEP-WCMC's work engaging the private sector, primarily the extractive industries, before giving real world examples of the science-government-business interface and implications for conservation.
