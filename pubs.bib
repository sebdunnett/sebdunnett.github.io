	title = {Can biodiversity offsetting follow in carbon's footprints?},
	abstract = {1. Biodiversity is the natural capital on which global economies are built. Despite this, biodiversity is still in decline, drawing ever more frequent comparisons to Earth’s five mass extinction events. Offsetting residual biodiversity impacts of damaging projects has been proposed by many to combat one of the main drivers of this decline as identified by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: land use change as a result of economic growth and development. This literature review assesses the potential for a global biodiversity offsets market by comparison with the global carbon market, arguably the most successful environmental market in terms of market value and volumes traded.
2. The current state of both carbon and biodiversity offset markets is reviewed, and their relative strengths and weaknesses analysed. Possible factors contributing to the success of the carbon market are identified; these are then mapped onto the biodiversity market in an attempt to predict whether it can follow the same trajectory as carbon offsetting, especially with regards to the establishment of a biodiversity disclosure project.
3. The global carbon market, as driven by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), has matured into a significant environmental market, with a market value of US\$176 billion and 10,281 MtCO2 volume traded. The market, especially the voluntary component, has been heavily criticised for lack of quality assurance. The factors contributing to carbon’s success were identified to be the homogeneity of emissions, high volume of carbon research, quantitative nature, timing, and offset location. The global biodiversity market is very much smaller, with a market value of US\$2.4-\$4 billion and 187,000 hectares protected or restored. Four biodiversity market case studies were analysed. The literature highlighted significant compliance and monitoring issues in the U.S.; this non-compliance has led to the failure to achieve the policy of no net loss both of wetland and wetland function. 
4. This review found that the factors identified proved not to map well onto a potential biodiversity market. Biodiversity suffers from significant ignorance and sizeable gaps in knowledge, which does not align well with the quantitative nature of financial markets. Although a biodiversity market would share similar considerable institutional frameworks and environmental policy acceptance as the current carbon market, understanding of the complexity of biodiversity at the most basic level is found likely to prove a significant hindrance to the establishment of a global market. This review also found fertile ground for the creation of a biodiversity disclosure project, but no significant steps to seed one. The overwhelming conclusion is that biodiversity offsetting is unlikely to form a sizeable market comparable to carbon, and that biodiversity conservation efforts should continue to be focussed elsewhere.},

	title = {Assessing potential spatial trade-offs between renewable energy expansion and biodiversity conservation},
	url = {https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/446664/},
	abstract = {Energy systems need decarbonisation in order to limit global warming to within safe limits. Unfettered climate change has the potential to greatly exacerbate species extinctions already much higher than historic baselines. Renewable energy technologies, especially solar photovoltaic and wind, have the potential to greatly aid in this decarbonisation but there are concerns as to the land required when compared to conventional, energy-dense, fuels. This is especially true given the urgent need to demarcate more land for biodiversity conservation. However, attempts to evidence these land concerns are hindered by lack of quality spatial data. This thesis shows, using newly generated spatially explicit data, that the expansion of renewable energy and biodiversity conservation do not necessarily con?ict. I ?nd, using a novel global, open access, harmonised dataset of onshore wind and solar photovoltaic installations, that although there are currently numerous overlaps with areas of conservation importance worldwide, echoing previous studies, when historic distributions are taken into account there is no evidence that energy-biodiversity con?ict is set to increase in the future. I also ?nd that although priority areas for biodiversity conservation have been identi?ed well in prior work, identi?cation of priority areas for renewable energy needs improvement. The results presented here suggest that more thoughtful planning of renewable energy can ensure no more potential impact on biodiversity than expected under a business as usual development scenario. I anticipate the data will support more research into what drives renewable energy siting, as well as providing a potential avenue for civil society to assess governmental progress towards clean energy objectives, for example Target 7.1 and 7.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the methods here provide a framework into which local impacts of renewable energy on biodiversity can be incorporated when they are better known.},
