Reviving an old Twitter thread to expedite my first ever blog contribution; as a lifelong environmentalist, I'm a fan of recycling. If you want to check out the original thread, and its total lack of engagement, it's [here](https://twitter.com/sebdunnett/status/1579782734406643712).

You might have seen the UK government [plans to tighten restrictions for field solar on farmland](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms) back in October last year. Although it [didn't go through in the end](https://solarenergyuk.org/news/a-turning-point-government-ends-solar-farm-uncertainty/), the false dichotomy of farming vs solar energy keeps getting peddled. Here's ITV going all clickbait with "[Heating or eating?](https://twitter.com/ITVWales/status/1626893034117017600?s=20)". Most commentators I've seen use non-spatial figures so I decided to dive into the spatial data to answer the question: has the government "fixed" a non-existent problem?

::: {.callout-note}
Caveat: this concerns England only as that's where the agricultural data covers, but that shouldn't matter much as 90% of solar is in England (sorry Andy...).

Firstly, we need data for solar locations. Back in 2016 when I started my PhD, there were very little spatial data for renewable energy -- one of the drivers for my first paper [@dunnettHarmonisedGlobalDatasets2020a]; thankfully it's not as bad now. I used data from a study that took a similar approach to ours, but with a much more detailed focus on the UK.

```{r}
#| cache: true
#| code-fold: true
# polygons from Stowell et al
solar = st_read("data/ukpvgeo_geometries.geojson", quiet=TRUE) %>% 
  st_transform(prj)

solar_poly_area_km2 = sum(st_area(solar)) %>% units::set_units(km2)

# points from Stowell et al
solar_pts = read.csv("data/ukpvgeo_points.csv") %>%
  drop_na(latitude,longitude) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords=c("longitude","latitude"),crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(27700) %>% 
  filter(located %ni% c("roof","rood","roof`","root")) # couple of spelling mistakes in the data

solar_uk_area_km2 = sum(solar_pts$area_sqm,na.rm=T) %>% units::set_units(m2) %>% units::set_units(km2)
solar_uk_pct = solar_uk_area_km2/(sum(st_area(uk)) %>% units::set_units(km2))
```

@Stowell2020 produced point data with area as an attribute, as well as polygons; the difference between the two was only `r abs(solar_uk_area_km2-solar_poly_area_km2)` km^2^. I ended up using areas calculated from the polygons. As most of this debate has centered on ground-mounted solar, I've filtered out any roof-mounted. This gave the percentage of land used for solar in the UK as a whopping *`r solar_uk_pct*100`%*.

# Agricultural grading

So here's the crux of the issue: agricultural land classification. 1 is best, 5 is worst. In practice, 3 is split into 3a and 3b, but I'm using data from Natural England that annoyingly doesn't split 3 so we'll have to make do.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Distribution of agricultural land classification grades in England. Non-agricultural land covers golf course, sports pitches, and public and private parks.
#| cache: true

alc = st_read("data/Provisional_Agricultural_Land_Classification_(ALC)_(England).geojson",
              quiet=TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(27700) %>% 
  filter(ALC_GRADE!="Exclusion")

alc$AREA <- st_area(alc)

# palette for alc plot
 alc_pal = scico(n=7,palette="acton")

showtext_auto()

ggplot(alc %>% filter(ALC_GRADE!="Exclusion")) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=ALC_GRADE),col=NA) +
  cowplot::theme_map() +
  scale_fill_manual(name="Agricultural grade",values = alc_pal) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(family="mulish", size = 30),
        legend.text = element_text(family="mulish", size = 20))
```
```{r}

# summarise by grade
alc_summary = st_drop_geometry(alc) %>% 
  group_by(ALC_GRADE) %>% 
  summarise(alc_total_area_sqm = sum(AREA,na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(prop = alc_total_area_sqm/sum(alc_total_area_sqm))

# best & most versatile = Grades 1-3a
bmv_pct = sum(alc_summary[2:4,2])/units::drop_units(st_area(eng))
bmv_area_km2 = sum(alc_summary[2:4,2]) %>% units::set_units(m2) %>% units::set_units(km2)

```

"Best & most versatile" (BMV) refers to the best quality agricultural land: Grades 1-3a. The proposals at the end of last year were to include 3b. Importantly, current planning guidance **already favours** farming over solar on BMV land.

Grades 1-3 cover `r bmv_pct*100`% of England's area, `r bmv_area_km2` km^2^.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Percentage land taken up by ground-mounted solar for each agricultural grade.

# spatially join agricultural grades to solar data
solar_alc = st_join(solar_pts,dplyr::select(alc,ALC_GRADE)) %>% 
  drop_na(ALC_GRADE)

# summarise by grade
solar_alc_summary = solar_alc %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(ALC_GRADE) %>% 
  summarise(solar_total_area_sqm=sum(area_sqm,na.rm = T) %>% units::set_units(m2))%>% 
  left_join(dplyr::select(alc_summary, ALC_GRADE, alc_total_area_sqm),by="ALC_GRADE") %>% 
  mutate(pct = units::drop_units(solar_total_area_sqm/alc_total_area_sqm))

# area & pct of solar in England
solar_eng_area_km2 = sum(solar_alc$area_sqm,na.rm=T) %>% units::set_units(m2) %>% units::set_units(km2)
solar_eng_pct = solar_eng_area_km2/(st_area(eng) %>% units::set_units(km2))

# table of ALC grades and % solar
solar_alc_summary %>% 
  dplyr::select(ALC_GRADE,pct) %>% 
  mutate(pct=scales::percent(pct, accuracy=0.001)) %>%
  rename("Agricultural grade" = ALC_GRADE,
         "%" = pct) %>% 
  kable %>% 
  kable_styling

```

Ground-mounted solar infrastructure covers `r scales::percent(units::drop_units(solar_eng_pct), accuracy=0.001)` of England so it does look like solar is slightly over-represented in higher agricultural classes compared to England on average (see table above), but this is likely exacerbated by obvious constraints such as the tiny percentage of ground-mounted solar in cities (*not* a surprising finding!). Regardless, these are still *tiny* proportions: the proportion in Grade 1 translates to 1 km^2^ in 3,614!

# Solar in development

What about future solar developments? For this I had to dive back into the (terrible) Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD). Serious BEIS, please, please sort it out. They have MW capacities but not areas so I used Dr Simon Evan's, [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/)'s factchecker extraordinaire, conversion: ~25 acres (0.1 km^2^ in normal units) per 5 MW.

```{r}
#| warning: false

# import REPD and fix it
repd = read.csv("data/repd-january-2023.csv", fileEncoding="latin1") %>%
  mutate(across(X.coordinate:Y.coordinate,as.numeric)) %>%
  drop_na(X.coordinate,Y.coordinate) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords=c("X.coordinate","Y.coordinate"),crs=27700) %>% 
  filter(Technology.Type=="Solar Photovoltaics" &
           Mounting.Type.for.Solar!="Roof") %>% 
  mutate(approx_area_sqm = `Installed.Capacity..MWelec.`*20234.36 %>% units::set_units(m2))

# spatial join with ALC grades
repd_alc = st_join(repd,dplyr::select(alc,ALC_GRADE)) %>% 
  drop_na(ALC_GRADE)

# summarise by ALC grade and development stage
repd_alc_summary = repd_alc %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(ALC_GRADE,Development.Status..short.) %>% 
  summarise(total_area_sqm = sum(approx_area_sqm,na.rm=T),
            total_MW = sum(Installed.Capacity..MWelec.,na.rm=T) %>% units::set_units(MW))

# group projects in general construction phase
construction = filter(repd_alc_summary, Development.Status..short. %in% c("Awaiting Construction","Under Construction")) %>% 
  group_by(ALC_GRADE) %>% 
  summarise(constr_solar=sum(total_area_sqm,na.rm=T),
            constr_solar_MW=sum(total_MW,na.rm=T))

# group projects in planning
planning = filter(repd_alc_summary, Development.Status..short. %in% c("Application Submitted","Pre-Planning","Revised","Scoping")) %>% 
  group_by(ALC_GRADE) %>% 
  summarise(plan_solar=sum(total_area_sqm,na.rm=T),
            plan_solar_MW=sum(total_MW,na.rm=T))

# total solar area per ALC grade
solar_alc_areas <- solar_alc_summary %>% dplyr::select(ALC_GRADE,solar_total_area_sqm)
names(solar_alc_areas) <- c("ALC_GRADE","operating_solar")

# join all
out <- list(solar_alc_areas,planning,construction,alc_summary[,c("ALC_GRADE","alc_total_area_sqm")]) %>% 
  reduce(left_join) %>% 
  mutate(operating_pct = units::drop_units(operating_solar/alc_total_area_sqm),
         operatingplus_pct = units::drop_units((operating_solar + plan_solar + constr_solar)/alc_total_area_sqm))

# Planned solar in Grade 3
# Percentage increase
g3_pre <- out[[3,8]]
g3_post <- out[[3,9]]

# Area added
area_added <- units::set_units(out[[3,3]] + out[[3,5]],km2)

# GW added
gw_added <- out[[3,6]]/1000

```

So *if* every single planned and under construction installation makes it to operation, and that's a big if looking at the rates of application refusal/withdrawal etc. in the REPD, solar area in Grade 3 would increase from `r g3_pre`% to `r g3_post`%.

                "Awaiting Construction",
                "Under Construction",
                "Operational",
                "Application Refused")

# filter interesting categories to make plot readable
repd_alc_summary = filter(repd_alc_summary,
                          Development.Status..short. %in% of_interest)

# colourblind friendly palette
pal = scico(palette="tokyo", n=5)

# plot solar project area by development phase
ggplot(repd_alc_summary %>%
         mutate(total_area_sqm = units::set_units(total_area_sqm,km2))) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=ALC_GRADE,y=total_area_sqm,fill=Development.Status..short.), stat="identity") +

  ylab("Area") +
  xlab("Agricultural grade") +
  theme(text=element_text(family="mulish", size = 25)) +

  scale_x_discrete(limits=rev)

```

Had they been banned by Defra, we may have lost out on an extra *`r area_added` km^2^* of panels & *`r gw_added` GW of capacity*. I'll let others work out how many houses that could be powering.

And this doesn't even acknowledge that many of these installations are *wanted by the farmers* who will indisputably know the land better than any top-down classification.

Also - agrivoltaics people! It's not a new thing and has been shown to be highly effective for producing multiple benefits across the food-energy-water nexus [@barron-gaffordAgrivoltaicsProvideMutual2019]; eating vs solar heating is a manufactured dichotomy.
